TODO: describe how REST API requests will be forwarded from the load balancers to the OTT monoliths

When a REST API request is made to the OpenTogetherTube system, it is first received by the NGINX reverse proxy server. 
NGINX then forwards the request to one of the OTT monoliths based on the current load balancing algorithm in use. 
The monolith that receives the request will then process it and return a response, which will be sent back to the 
NGINX reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server will then forward the response back to the client that made the 
original request.
