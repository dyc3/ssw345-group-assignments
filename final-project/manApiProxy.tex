TODO: describe how REST API requests will be forwarded from the load balancers to the OTT monoliths

When a REST API request is made to the OpenTogetherTube system, the request is first received by the load balancer. The 
load balancer then selects one of the OTT monoliths based on the current load balancing algorithm, and forwards the 
request to the selected monolith's nginx reverse proxy server.
The nginx reverse proxy server receives the request and forwards it to the corresponding monolith for processing. 
The monolith processes the request and sends a response back to its nginx reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server 
then returns the response to the load balancer, which in turn sends the response back to the client that made the original
request.
