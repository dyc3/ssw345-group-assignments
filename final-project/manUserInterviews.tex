\section{Interview: Jay Creamer}

User: Jay Creamer (friend) \\
Interviewer: Carson McManus

\textbf{Do you often share videos with your friends?}

Yes, frequently, multiple times per week.

\textbf{Have you ever watched videos with your friends?}

Yes.

\textbf{Tell me about the last time you had a watch party.}

Last night when we were watching those documentaries on OTT.

\textbf{How do you feel about OTT as a platform?}

I like it. It's simple and easy to use. Other platforms are too complicated, and filled with ads.

\textbf{How often do you encounter problems with OTT? Specifically, down time, losing room state, or unresponsiveness.}

I haven't used it frequently enough to encounter many problems like that.

\textbf{Do you use permanent rooms?}

Yes.

\textbf{Would you say that using permanent rooms is more convenient than temporary rooms?}

Yes, it's more convenient to have a dedicated space for my friends and me to gather and watch videos together. But it depends on the situation. If I'm just sharing a video with a random friend, I'll use a temporary room.

\textbf{If you wanted to watch a video with a friend, but OTT was not available, what would you do?}

If OTT is down, I would use another service.

\textbf{If OTT kept having problems, would you continue to use it?}

It's different because I know you, so I would be more likely to continue using it. But if it was a service I didn't know, I would probably stop using it.
