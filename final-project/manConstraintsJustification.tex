\section{Browser Websocket API Contraints}

The Websocket API allows for one to open a bidirectional communication session between a browser and a server. The connection session stays open until the browser or server terminates it. 
This allows for the client and server to send information to the other simultaneously. While useful, it does have constraints. 
The Websocket API does not allow custom HTTP headers, which means that authorization has to be done after the connection request has been made.
