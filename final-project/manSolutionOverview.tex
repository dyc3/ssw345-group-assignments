\section{A Smart Load Balancer}

The solution to scaling OTT is to use a load balancer.

\subsection{What is a load balancer?}

A load balancer is a server that distributes load across multiple servers. It is a common solution to the problem of scaling a web application.

\subsection{New Architecture}

With the load balancer, OTT's architecture will look like this: Figure \ref{fig:ott-architecture-with-load-balancer}

\end{figure}

The load balancer must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Distribute load across multiple servers
  \item Forward HTTP requests to the correct Monolith
  \item Send WebSocket messages to the correct Monolith
\end{itemize}

These requirements imply that a normal HTTP load balancer (like nginx) will not work, and the need for a specialized implementation. The specifics of how the load balancer will work will be discussed in the following chapters.
