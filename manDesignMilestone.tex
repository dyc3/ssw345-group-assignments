Problem Statement

What: OpenTogetherTubeâ€™s current architecture is haphazardly planned and pretty inefficient.
Why:  When it comes time to scale up, OTT should be prepared 

Tagline: Horizontal Scaling for OpenTogetherTube

Project Description

OpenTogetherTube is a very complex piece of software, and we want to be prepared to scale up when the time comes. OTT's current architecture is haphazardly planned and pretty inefficient. 
Horizontal scaling is taking what is on one computer and putting it on another computer as well. Adding multiple computers can spread the load across multiple devices.
